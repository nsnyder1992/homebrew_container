LittleP6 is a lot like [TinyD6](https://www.gallantknightgames.com/tinyd6/) and [Advanced Tiny Dungeons](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/393397/advanced-tiny-dungeon), but built to be more modular. It takes some basic ideas from [Core D8](https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2020/11/25/the-d8-role-playing-system/) and [DC20](https://thedungeoncoach.com/pages/dc20), giving it, it's modularity without totally leaving behind its simple beginnings. The main ideas behind LittleP6 were:

1. Add simple Attributes you could level up
2. PC should succeed more often than not when at their skill level. (Average 70% success)
3. Add Class Structures, but still keep most TinyD6 Traits open to all
4. Be able to run longer campaigns
5. Be customizable and allow players and GMs to work together to build their story how they want to.

LittleP6 aims to be a rules medium platform to allow modularity, but keep it simple. Allowing rules light users to level up their play and for more advanced users, an escape to a more narrative based game with simple rules and math.

### Where does the P come from

The **P** stands for Poisson Distribution, this idea originally came from [Core D8](https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2020/11/25/the-d8-role-playing-system/), where a Poisson Distribution better represent human talent. Though Core D8 use d8 dice and we wanted users to still be able to use the household d6 dice. The distribution is pretty nice, and keeps success rates around 70% for normal skill level. It also makes it closer to 90% if you are above average at the skill and closer to 50% if you are below average. In the US this is how school works, so we say it's close enough :).

### Primes, Classes, Stamina, & Mana

The idea of Prime Attributes, Classes, Stamina, and Mana comes from [DC20](https://thedungeoncoach.com/pages/dc20). DC20 has some great ideas and we love them. One thing TinyD6 didn't have was away to limit magic or users from using their traits obsessively. Yes you could use 1d6, roll a one and your done, but we want something a little more concrete. So we stole the idea of stamina and Mana from DC20, with our own little twist to make it a little more simple. We also are using some of the same classes with some of the same "Traits". But put into the "Tiny" world platform. And the last idea influenced by DC20, is it's Prime Modifier/Attribute, this is what is used for you Awareness Tests though rolling of course is a little different :).

### TinyD6 & Advanced Tiny Dungeons

Last but not least this game takes a lot from TinyD6 and it's big brother Advanced Tiny Dungeons. We use simple Tests to determine what passes and what doesn't and Difficulty levels. We also take the same approach to character building, besides Attributes & Classes. Besides that it's still the same engine with a few new rules!
